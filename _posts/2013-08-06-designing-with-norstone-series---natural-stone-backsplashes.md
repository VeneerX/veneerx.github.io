excerpt: "When designing a kitchen, there are a lot of little details to think about - cabinets, countertops, appliances, island or no island, flooring and more. The one detail that is often overlooked, or saved for last, is the backsplash - but it shouldn't be!  The backsplash can tie all the little details together and be the finishing touch on the kitchen.

Here are a few design ideas using natural stone as a non traditional backsplash medium."

<span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px">When designing a kitchen, there are a LOT of little details to think about -</span> The one detail that is often overlooked, or saved for last, is the [backsplash](/gallery/application/backsplash/). Ultimately, the backsplash is a focal point of your kitchen, the area that can tie it all together. It is the finishing touch. The cherry on top. Since natural stone is rich in texture and color variation, it is a great choice for this integral part of your project. Below we discuss some stone backsplash ideas for kitchens and baths.

[Charcoal Natural Stone Backsplash](/assets/images/blog/Charcoal-Natural-Stone-Backsplash.jpg){: align="left"} Stacked stone is a unique idea for a backsplash that is looking to stand out from the crowd. A product like our Norstone [Rock Panels](/products/stacked-stone-cladding/), with a choice of colors, ensures there will be a shade to coordinate with your cabinets and countertops. Ochre and White look great with cherry and dark granite while Ivory and Charcoal play well with cream and Formica. The mix and match combinations are endless! The colors are also neutral which make the rock panels versatile and timeless. The rough, split face texture provides a nice contrast to the smoothness and sleekness of the appliances and other accents in the space. And since they [install](/how-to-install-stacked-stone/) similar to tile you get the familiarity and ease of installation of a tile backsplash with a whole new twist.

Norstone's line of [Basalt Interlocking Tiles](/products/modern-wall-tile/) are another unique idea for a stone backsplash. Cooled lava, manufactured into tiles, is not something you see every day and your houseguests will take notice! Their smooth texture gives the product a more modern feel and a sleek, streamlined look. Available in an Ash Grey and Ebony, the color options are limited but coordinate well with stainless steel and the gray marbling commonly found in granite. These are traditional tile mosaics in that they need to be grouted and come on a mesh backing. ![Basalt Natural Stone Backsplash](/assets/images/blog/Basalt-Natural-Stone-Backsplash.jpg)

Travertine, granite, slate, and river rock are other great stone backsplash ideas that come in a variety of different colors, textures, styles, and installation methods offering even more options for your stone backsplash.

Also, don't shy away from using natural stone as your backsplash because you are worried about the cleanup. If you seal natural stone, it can be cleaned with a mild detergent and a soft bristle brush. Pasta sauce, grease or anything else will simply wipe off with a wet sponge and some dish soap.

Overall, using natural stone for your backsplash is going to accentuate a normally bland space and create visual interest. Break free from painted drywall and think outside the box. Let your backsplash do more than just protect your walls from splatters and spills.
