No longer just a product site, no longer just a beta, Norstone now has a living breathing Blog for our customers to enjoy, learn from, and share in.

A couple of hours ago, Rassan, Kevin, Ross, and Mandy put the final touches on Norstone's new site launch, along with this blog, and launched it to the world. What a great feeling. We have all worked really hard to get our products and website to a level our customers will truly appreciate, and now it's time to blog all about it. We want this to be a space that is less commercially focused and instead more learning focused. To teach our customers how to use our products to really shine in their project, and to show them what inspires us to do what we do. Sweet!

Thanks a ton to everyone in the company who's been a driving force in getting both the site and the blog ready. And thanks to our customers - you guys - who will now hopefully enjoy what we have to say here and share in our love for all things design.
