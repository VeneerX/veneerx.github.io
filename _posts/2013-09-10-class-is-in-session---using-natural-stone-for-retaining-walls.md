<span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px">Retaining walls have been around for hundreds, even thousands, of years, mainly serving the purpose of controlling erosion and soil movement on sloping ground.</span> However, a retaining wall can also help give a property more vertical character or provide a decorative element. Retaining walls, which are often implemented into landscape design, can help to enhance other components of the landscaping such as water features, plants, flowers and trees. They can also be used to divide large areas or create privacy. While there is a vast array of materials which can be used to construct a retaining wall, natural stone is the most common and has been used since ancient times for the purpose. Let's explore more about how stone has been used over time to create retaining walls and what advantages today's natural stone retaining wall products provide.

Natural stone retaining walls, made of loose stone, date back to ancient times and helped define fields, villages, housing and more. For this type of application, rarely used today, stones had to be stacked, placed one by one by a specialist or mason. While beautiful, this type of application did present some limitations. The finished product was somewhat loose, not uniform, and very, very labor intensive. As a result of the time required to build this type of retaining wall, it was very costly, even by today's standards.

Concrete block has the advantage of being available in component sized units that are easy to deliver and work with to create retaining walls in varied shapes and sizes. Â However, as we see in the picture to the right, concrete block while sturdy and utilitarian, leaves much to be desired from an aesthetic standpoint.
