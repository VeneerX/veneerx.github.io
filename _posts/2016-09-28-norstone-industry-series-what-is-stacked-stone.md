In days past, people would use the stones they had available, hand cutting and laying stones. A traditional stacked stone wall might not even use a bonding agent like concrete. Stones would be laid so carefully that the weight of the stones and their positioning in the wall is what held them together.

This process was very labor intensive and still is. Even with precut slabs of stone, it takes professional masons to deliver a quality finish. Over time people came to love the look and incorporated it in columns, cladding homes, building fireplaces and other design details. Seen as a sign of wealth due to the need for both mass amounts of material and skilled labor the stack stone look became coveted the world around.

A stunning quality of stacked stone is the unique look it has. Built from stones of all different sizes and often a natural spectrum of color stack stone has a raw yet refined look. Fast forward to today, stacked stone is one of the most popular contemporary design looks. Advances in manufacturing make it possible to expertly mount stones to wall panels. This makes it possible to quickly and easily incorporate stacked stone into a variety of designs with far less labor.
