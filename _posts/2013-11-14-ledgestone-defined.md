![Ledgestone traditional](/assets/images/blog/Ledgestone---Traditional.jpg){: align="right"} <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:lighter;letter-spacing:1px">Ledgestone is one of the truly classic stone styles that has withstood the test of time with only slight refinements along the way.</span> In its most basic sense, ledgestone is a pattern of stonework utilizing horizontal joints. The pattern is typically made up of individually stacked pieces of stone where the horizontal ledge is more defined than the vertical joins. Traditionally this look was achieved by laying the stone piece by piece by hand. While this technique is tried and true, it is also very time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive if paying a mason or specialist to complete the work.

These panels, like Norstone's stacked stone [Rock Panels](/products/stacked-stone-cladding/), are quick and easy to install and take the skilled work out of creating that refined ledgestone look. Norstone varies the length and, in some colors, height of the individual stones in each panel which contributes to the overall design and uniqueness of each panel and the product in general. Be careful though when shopping around for panel system products - there are faux ledgestone panels where the “stone" is made out of molded concrete or even polyurethane. While these products might save some cost upfront, these faux ledgestone panels do not hold up as well as natural stone and will certainly lack the authenticity a natural stone veneer will add to your project. Ledgestone comes in many colors and blends, so finding the right color for your project should not be a concern.

Now that we've defined ledgestone and the various types out there, let's discuss how it is used. Ledgestone is great for many applications. It can be applied to exterior projects such as outdoor kitchens, retaining walls, exterior feature walls and even pools and water features. It is also a popular accent for front porches and columns. For as many exterior uses, there are just as many, if not more interior uses. Ledgestone looks great on fireplaces, backsplashes and even in bathrooms to give a spa like feel to the space. It is also great to use in sunrooms to bring a little of the outdoors in.

![Ledgestone Modern Design](/assets/images/blog/Ledgestone---Modern-Design.jpg){: align="right"} The other appealing feature of ledgestone is its diversity and ability to fit into most décor schemes. As a result of the emphasis on the horizontal joints, the stone stays traditional but the layout can lend to a somewhat contemporary feel. It is a nice blend of the old and new, traditional yet modern. The height and shape of the individual pieces in a ledgestone will also dictate how modern or traditional it appears.

Overall, ledgestone is a great option when considering a hard surface wall finish and is a look that has stood the test of time, both literally and in the design sense. Today we have options to make it an affordable reality in our own homes. Hopefully the information in this article has given you a better idea of what ledgestone is all about and why it might be a good fit for your project.
