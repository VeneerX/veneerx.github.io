It is also extremely important to feel visually comfortable in order to be able to fully enjoy what is generally known as the busiest room in the house. In this Norstone Designer Series blog we will be discussing the use of mosaic tile options for the kitchen, which would primarily be used for backsplashes. To start with a little background, mosaic originated as the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. Mosaics are rooted in ancient times and are one of mankind's oldest art forms.  They continue to endure as a globally popular and, with today's technology, economical form of interior decoration. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, multi shaped pieces of stone or glass that comes in many different colors, known as Tesserae, but mosaics, especially floor mosaics, may also be made of small rounded pieces of stone and called "pebble mosaics". With modern day building supplies, design materials and tools, the choices for mosaic patterns, colors and application ideas are virtually endless. The use of ceramics, stained glass and metal are part of the list of the mosaic family of products as well.

One drawback with authentic piece by piece hand laid mosaics is that they are time consuming to install and require an artist's touch to transform individual pieces into what eventually becomes art. The talent level needed for this type of application is extremely high and should be strictly handled by professionals that have lots of training and experience at this method of installation, which increases the cost and time needed for installation. Tile manufacturers are meeting consumer's demands for mosaic applications by pre-mounting the mosaics onto various backing systems, including mesh and plastic. By pre-mounting the mosaic to a backer, the mosaic can be installed in standard size sections, similar to any other wall tile, and will often interlock with neighboring sections. While a pre-mounted mosaic tile product might not have the "hand laid" feel of traditional mosaic, they are much easier to install and are often tackled as a DIY project by homeowners.

Trends in mosaic tile backsplashes are dynamic and always changing and while traditional mosaics will continue to offer up a timeless look, pre-mounted mosaics offer an attractive alternative to achieve a similar look with the benefit of an easier, more cost effective installation. Whichever direction you decide to go when you create a mosaic tile backsplash always try to have fun and make it your own. The goal should be to make this space comfortable and appealing as well as beautiful and functional - and the backsplash is your canvas to do so. Happy designing!
