  body: Norstone Ivory Quartz Stacked Stone Rock Panels meld perfectly into the Mediterranean countryside of this vacation home located on the Greek Island of Cyprus. A unique "see thru" kitchen allows a retaining wall clad with the stone to be enjoyed by guests both inside and outside, while a cleverly designed feature wall forms a functional backdrop for an outdoor terrace with million dollar views.

  body: "The sun baked shores of the Island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, with it's stunning golden sand beaches and inspiring stone and marble Roman era ruins, are a perfect match for the lighter tones of the Ivory Rock Panel.  Perfectly suited for outdoor use, the Ivory color blends perfectly into this Mediterranean countryside location and will work well in any island / beach themed design where life is lived outdoors.</p><p><a href='/products/rock-panels/ivory/'>Visit Product Page</a>"
