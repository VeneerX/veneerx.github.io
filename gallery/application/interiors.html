  heading: Norstone, Anywhere &amp; Everywhere
  body: Norstone <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding'>Rock Panels</a> are a
    great choice for any interior stone veneer project where a unique and fresh look
    is desired.  Projects ranging from entryways, alcoves, stairwells, accent and
    feature walls, powder rooms, fireplaces and many more are all suitable for an
    interior stacked stone wall.  It never ceases to amaze the team at Norstone the
    different ways our customers dream up to use our products on indoor stone veneer
    projects.
- heading: Starting Out Right
  body: The most important consideration for an interior stone veneer project is making
    sure the wall itself is suitable for installation.  Norstone Rock Panels weigh
    about 12.5 lbs / sq ft, making most normal drywall or sheetrock wall substrates
    unsuitable for an interior rock wall installation.  This is easily remedied by
    installating cement board over the existing wallboard and then installing the
    interior stone veneer over the freshly prepared substrate. Stone veneer interior
    walls have never been so easy!  For more details on how to install stone veneer
    panels on interior walls check out our installation instructions. </p><a href='/how-to-install-stacked-stone'>Norstone&rsquo;s

- heading: Finishing Touches
  body: A number of options are available for adding extra design elements to an interior
    stone veneer wall panels. One of the most popular is lighting, which can be projected
    either upward, downward, or designed to back light the stone, and controlled for
    brightness and color.  Art pieces can also be incorporated into an interior stacked
    stone project, using a diamond-tipped masonry drill bit to drill through the stone
    to set the anchor points.
