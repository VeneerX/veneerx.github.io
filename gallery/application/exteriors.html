  heading: Where It All Began
  body: Norstone Rock Panels originated as a landscaping product, and while architects and designers have found lots of other ways to use the product, its origins shine through when used as an exterior stacked stone.  The quartz and quartz based stones make the product incredibly durable and an excellent choice for an exterior wall cladding project.

  heading: It's Bigger Out Here
  body: Exterior projects tends to be larger in size than interior projects - it's a simple fact that there is often lots more room outside than in.  Norstone's panel system allows for installers to achieve installation rates closely mirroring tile, far outpacing hand stacked loose stone, allowing for exterior stone veneer projects to be completed more quickly and cost effectively.  Norstone's larger format <a href="/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels">XL Rock Panels</a>, featuring larger individual stone sizes than the <a href="/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Standard Series</a>, are an ideal fit for many exterior stone cladding projects which would benefit from a larger and therefore more consistent look over a large installation.

  heading: Setting Boundaries - Pushing the Limit
  body: Stacked stone exterior walls have long served the purposes of defining boundaries - be it defining a plot of land or fortifying an impenetrable castle. Norstone Standard and XL Series Rock Panels are an ideal product for outside stone walls because of the high volume output made possible by the panel system. Never has having an exterior stacked stone wall been easier or more affordable.

  heading: An Open Book of Possibilities
  body: Using stacked stone for exterior walls should not just be limited to the exteriors of buildings or to define property lines. Garden walls, terraced retaining walls, and privacy screens are all idea applications for exterior wall stone. Why settle for boring painted stucco, bland brick or a fence that'll need replaced in a few years when having a stone exterior wall is now as easy as setting tile?

    <p class="text-justify">Certain things like corrosive cleaning agents, excessive salt, or other chemicals that might be present in an exterior installation can potentially harm the finish of a stone cladding project.  Sealing the stone with a water based, penetrating sealer post installation is a good idea to maintain and protect the stone finish over time.</p>
