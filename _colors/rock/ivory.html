<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Play it Smooth with the Mellow Ivory Quartz</h3>
<p>Smooth is the perfect description of our Ivory color. For those that prefer the warm and mellow tones of whites, creams, golds and yellows, Ivory will provide the perfect backdrop for their interior or exterior project. Creating exceptional contrast when paired with darker flooring, trim, or accent pieces, Ivory is an ideal stone for unique fireplaces, landscape walls, and pool environments.</p>
