<h2 class="xx-large color-primary" style="font-weight: normal">The XL Rock Panel Collection</h2>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary"><em>Thin Stone Veneer just got a whole lot Bigger, Bolder, and Badder.</em></h3>
<p>Offering larger individual stones and a unique interlocking edge profile, XL Rock Panels are an ideal thin stone veneer for jobs where a larger stone look is desired. The cut stones within the XL Rock Panels are approximately TWICE the size of those
  found in our standard <a href="/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock Panel</a> collection, but maintain that same signature dry-stack look you know and love. These thin stone panels are perfect for commercial and residential facades,
  <a href="/gallery/xlx-rock-panels/exteriors">retaining walls</a>, broad feature walls, and tall <a href="/gallery/application/fireplace">stone fireplaces</a>. XL Rock Panels are available in our two primary exterior colors,
  <a href="/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre">Ochre Blend</a>, <a href="/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/charcoal">Charcoal</a>, and <a href="/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec">Aztec</a> colors.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary">New Unique Interlocking Design.</h3>
<p>XL Rock Panels offer a &quot;stepped&quot; interlocking edge profile, which allows one panel to interlock with its neighboring panel. This unique system decreases the size of the vertical seam between two panels from 6&rdquo; to 3&rdquo; which is
  important with larger sized individual stones and provides the most seamless look possible while still leveraging the easy to install nature of a panel system.</p>
<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Still The World's Most Advanced Corner System.</h3>
<p>XL Rock Panels also incorporate our two-part, finger-jointed corner system. The two-piece system offers a hassle free installation and provides the most seamless look possible. One section is longer than the other to allow an offset pattern to continue
  around the corner along the adjacent walls. Because they require little skill on the part of the contractors fixing our rock panels to a wall, they significantly reduce installation time and onsite labor costs, especially when compared to the
  time and skill involved in cutting and forming mitered corners.</p>

    <h4 class="color-primary">Natural Stone</h4>
    <p>Natural stone is one of history&rsquo;s oldest and most revered building materials. From the ancient pyramids of Egypt and the Coliseum of Rome all the way to the modern era, natural stone, in its many forms, has provided a cornerstone for
      building and design. Norstone&rsquo;s exclusive adaptation of this ancient medium into thin stone panels has further progressed natural stone to be used on places and in applications previously thought impossible. Norstone XL  Rock
      Panels adhere to the following characteristics:</p>
    <p><span itemprop="name">Norstone</span> XL Rock Panels are made from 100% natural stone and create a 3 dimensional thin stone veneer look.</p>
    <p>The Ochre Blend is a Quartzite based sedimentary stone.
      <br /> The Charcoal is a pure Quartz.
      <br /> The Aztec is a quartzite based sand stone.</p>

    <h4 class="color-primary">Installation</h4>
    <p>One of the most compelling reasons for choosing a thin stone panel system is the ease with which the product is installed. The panel system provides for rapid installation over prepared cementitious surfaces, such as cement board, brick
      / block, or a traditional lathe and scratch coat with a polymer modified tile thinset. Thin stone veneer is ideally cut on a tile wet saw and our XL Rock Panels have staggered edge profile, allowing the installer to interlock adjoining
      panels together, thus eliminating the need to grout or point mortar between individual pieces or units.</p>
    <p>Whether part of a large scale commercial application, or a small residential project, all levels of installers will find the XL Rock Panel quick and easy to install and a pleasure to work with.</p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Natural Stone Sealer</h4>
    <p>A natural stone sealer can be applied depending on the characteristics of the application or to achieve a desired look or finish.</p>
